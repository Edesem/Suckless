Requirements

In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

A release (v1.0) will come soon... ;)
After a long phase of inactivity, development has been continued!
